# Exploratory Data Analysis on Roller Coaster Dataset

This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of roller coasters, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis provides insights into various attributes of roller coasters and is designed to guide users through essential steps of data understanding, preprocessing, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The analysis follows a structured approach to:
1. **Data Understanding** – Initial data inspection, including shape, structure, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering unnecessary information.
3. **Visualization** – Using graphs and charts to explore trends and relationships between variables.

The dataset used in this analysis is accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/). The source of the notebook tutorial is the [Medallion Data Science YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxladMszXan-jfgzyeIMyvw).

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Roller coaster names, locations, and types
- Dimensions and speeds
- Rankings and other performance metrics

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the world of roller coasters, which allows us to draw interesting comparisons and insights.

## Installation and Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

Install the libraries using:
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

### Usage
